# 🌈 Convolutional Autoencoder for Grayscale to Color Image Conversion  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **Convolutional Autoencoder** using **TensorFlow** to convert grayscale images into colorized versions. The model learns efficient feature representations through an **encoder-decoder architecture** to reconstruct realistic colors for grayscale images.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **TensorFlow** – Deep Learning Framework  
- **Keras** – Model Building  
- **Python** – Scripting Language  
- **OpenCV & Matplotlib** – Image Processing & Visualization  

## 🏗 Model Architecture  
- **Encoder** 🏛: Compresses grayscale images into latent feature maps  
- **Decoder** 🎨: Reconstructs colorized images from learned representations  

## 📂 Dataset  
- Supports datasets like **CIFAR-10, ImageNet, or custom datasets**  
- Input: **Grayscale images** (1 channel)  
- Output: **Color images** (3 channels - RGB)  

## 🎯 Results  
- Generates realistic colorized images from grayscale inputs  
- Learns meaningful features without explicit supervision  

## 🛠 Usage  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/priyanshujiiii/ConvolutionAutoEncoder.git
cd convolutional-autoencoder    
```
